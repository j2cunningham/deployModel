## PURPOSE

The goal is to deploy on [Flask] a [deep learning] model as a microservice. The model is used to predict handwritten digits and it has been previously trained on a [Jupyter Notebook]. [REST API] are utilized to communicate with the deployed model. e.g. send image to be analized and return the generated predictions to the client.

## DEPENDENCIES

The code has been tested using:

* [Python] (3.6.8): an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
* [Flask] (1.0.2): a microframework for [Python] based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.
* [Gunicorn] (19.9.0): a [Python] [WSGI] HTTP Server for UNIX.
* [NGINX] (1.15.11): a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server, reverse proxy, and IMAP/POP3 proxy server.
* [Docker] (18.09.5-ce): an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
* [Docker-Compose] (1.24.0): a tool for defining and running multi-container [Docker] applications.
* [Keras] (2.2.4): a high-level neural networks [API], written in [Python] and capable of running on top of [TensorFlow], CNTK, or Theano.
* [Tensorflow] (1.13.1): an open source software [Deep Learning] library for high performance numerical computation using data flow graphs.
* [Matplotlib] (3.0.3): a plotting library for [Python] and its numerical mathematics extension [NumPy].
* [NumPy] (1.16.2): a library for [Python], adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* [scikit-image] (0.15.0): a collection of algorithms for image processing with [Python].
* [Conda] (4.6.11): a package and virtual environment manager included in [Python] Data Science Platform [Anaconda].

### PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Virtual environment (<env_name>=**dlflask36**) can be generated from **dlflask36.yaml**, **requirements.txt** files located in the repository.

Command to configure virtual environment with [Conda]:

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ conda env create -f dlflask36.yaml
~/deeplearning_flask$ conda activate dlflask36
(dlflask36)~/deeplearning_flask$
```

## ARCHITECTURE

The architecture created with [docker-compose] uses two different [Docker] containers for:

* [NGINX].
* [Flask] and [Gunicorn].

The following diagram illustrates the architecture in blocks:

```bash
            _______            __________________
           |       |          |                  |
Client <──>| NGINX ├<─bridge─>| Flask + Gunicorn |
           |       |          |                  |
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
```

## HOW TO RUN DEEP LEARNING ON FLASK WITH DOCKER COMPOSE

The steps and commands to run the [deep learning] model on the [Flask] server with [docker-compose] are described below.

Before executing [docker-compose] is strongly recommended to close other applications to free up resources and ports to avoid potential issues. Then [docker-compose] can be executed to build services.

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ docker-compose build
```

Next step consists in executing [docker-compose] up command.

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ docker-compose up
```

If everything goes fine at the end it should appear something similar to:

```bash
...
...
web_1_9b6c64fc338e | Using TensorFlow backend.
```

## TEST SERVER & REST API

There are different ways to check that the server is running properly. One is opening a web browser such as Chrome or Mozilla and paste the following URLs:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1/
```

The web browser should show the text "Deep Learning on Flask".

[REST API] can be tested with [pytest] or [curl].

It is possible to execute tests of [Flask] microservice created with [pytest] from inside the [Flask] [Docker] container using [Makefile]:

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ docker exec -it deeplearning_flask_web_1 /bin/bash
~/app# make test
...
test_app.py ..                                                         [100%]
```

A POST example using [curl] from outside [Docker] container is shown below:

```bash
~/deeplearning_flask$ curl -F file=@app/app/static/4.jpg -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1/api/predictlabel'
{
  "most_probable_label": "4",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "label": "0",
      "probability": "5.870073e-09"
    },
    {
      "label": "1",
      "probability": "1.0881397e-06"
    },
    {
      "label": "2",
      "probability": "9.185746e-06"
    },
    {
      "label": "3",
      "probability": "2.4672235e-07"
    },
    {
      "label": "4",
      "probability": "0.9999093"
    },
    {
      "label": "5",
      "probability": "2.981036e-07"
    },
    {
      "label": "6",
      "probability": "8.1526576e-07"
    },
    {
      "label": "7",
      "probability": "2.3985052e-05"
    },
    {
      "label": "8",
      "probability": "3.9896346e-05"
    },
    {
      "label": "9",
      "probability": "1.5145803e-05"
    }
  ],
  "success": true
}
